<h1> Requirements </h1>

* Load & display all the symbols in the /assets folder
* Display the players balance & stake amount (starting balance can be whatever you decide & stake should be adjustable by the player)
* Display a button which simulates a 'spin' such that when clicked it does the following:
	1. Deducts players stake from the current balance
	1. Randomly selectes a dummy JSON response from the responses I have provided
	1. From the response calculate if there was a win, if so add that to the players balance, play the 'win' animations for the correct winning symbols and display the win amount
	1. The button must remain disabled until all this has been completed
